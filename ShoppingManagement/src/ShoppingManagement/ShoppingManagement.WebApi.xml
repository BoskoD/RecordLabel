             <remarks>
             Requests can be narrowed down with a variety of query string values:
             ## Query String Parameters
             - **PageNumber**: An integer value that designates the page of records that should be returned.
             - **PageSize**: An integer value that designates the number of records returned on the given page that you would like to return. This value is capped by the internal MaxPageSize.
             - **SortOrder**: A comma delimited ordered list of property names to sort by. Adding a `-` before the name switches to sorting descendingly.
             - **Filters**: A comma delimited list of fields to filter by formatted as `{Name}{Operator}{Value}` where
                 - {Name} is the name of a filterable property. You can also have multiple names (for OR logic) by enclosing them in brackets and using a pipe delimiter, eg. `(LikeCount|CommentCount)>10` asks if LikeCount or CommentCount is >10
                 - {Operator} is one of the Operators below
                 - {Value} is the value to use for filtering. You can also have multiple values (for OR logic) by using a pipe delimiter, eg.`Title@= new|hot` will return posts with titles that contain the text "new" or "hot"
            
                | Operator | Meaning                       | Operator  | Meaning                                      |
